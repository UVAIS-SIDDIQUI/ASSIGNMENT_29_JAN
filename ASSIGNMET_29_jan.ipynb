    "Speaking of adding functionality to Python â€“ one of the major benefits of choosing Python as your programming language of choice (or even adding it as a second or third language) is the large amount of libraries you can incorporate into your code. A library is basically a piece of reusable code that can be used for common functions such as manipulating images, performing equations, database administration, regular expressions, and so forth.\n",

It is part of the reason I wrote a book about programming in the language for teenagers â€“ it is a great entry into programming software as a whole. Since the language is so simple to read and write in, it also makes a great second or third language to add to your developer resume."
